An analysis of crop suitability was conducted and presented in this report. For each crop and their given optimum temperature threshold, the calculation of cumulative distribution function was conducted. From the probability of exceedance of the thresholds, interpolated surfaces were generated using best-fitted kriging method. Some suitability maps were masked to identify the zone of risk corresponding to different crops. Finally, the difference between two selected climate periods were identified which give us the idea of changes of the suitability for each selected crop.
